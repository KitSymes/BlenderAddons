## About

This Repository hosts addons for Blender that I have made, that should help simplify some parts of an obscure workflow.

## Installing a Script

All you need from this Repository is to download the script that you want to install.

In Blender, click on Edit > Preferences, and in the new window make sure 'Add-ons' is the active tab. In the top right, click on Install, and select the downloaded script. Search for it, then check the box to enable it.

## Scripts

### 01 - Clone Vertex Groups Order
Lets you Copy and Paste the order of Vertex Groups between two Objects using their names. Names must be identical. Groups not present in the copied list will be moved to the bottom.
